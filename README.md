# OnlinePortfolio.GQ
Using the skills I learned at [HTMLAcademy.ru](https://htmlacademy.ru), I created a free, personal and entirely open-source web-portfolio.
Hopefully I've inspired you to do the same thing!
Enjoy!

Update: Portfolio has become quite outdated, new portfolio / source code can be found at [Kuzmin.GQ](http://kuzmin.gq).
